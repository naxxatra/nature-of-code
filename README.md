This is a github repository for the Coding and Simulations open project that we have been working on Naxxatra Discord Server.

***Project Overview***

In this open project, we are trying to make a basic attempt at visualizing motion in 2 Dimensions using Python and Pygame.

Pygame is a visualization library typically used for Game development. Here, we are using it to observe how our different particles are moving around by coding in the equations of motion. 

For reference, we are using the Nature of Code course on Kadenze: https://www.kadenze.com/courses/the-nature-of-code/info

It is also available for free on youtube on the channel "The Coding Train": https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZV4yEcW3uDwOgGXKUUsPOM

The course itself is an adaptation of the Nature of Code textbook written by Daniel Shiffman. While the logic they're implementing is largely similar to what we're doing, it is worth noting that Nature of Code is using p5.Js, while we are using Python. 

While we're using this course for reference, we're going off into tangents onto things like Computational Physics, methods of integration and such, while discussing and dealing with bugs that we're coming across while implementing. 

***Folder Structure***

Every week we are making progress/New Files to what we previously did. The Root folders are going to be split weekwise. ie, week 0, week 1, week 2, etc.

Inside each folder, we will have that week's notes in the form of a pdf, and everyone gets to maintain their own folders with their names/github ID/Discord ID. 

Within the user's individual folder, you can maintain your set of code for that particular week.
